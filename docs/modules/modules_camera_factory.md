# modules_camera_factory
[Back to Architecture Overview](../README.md)

## Purpose
Factory helpers for opening camera streams. The function prioritizes
FFmpeg and falls back to GStreamer when initialization fails.

## Key Classes
- **StreamUnavailable** - Raised when no capture backend can provide frames.

## Key Functions
- **open_capture(src, cam_id, src_type=None, resolution, rtsp_transport, use_gpu, capture_buffer, backend_priority=None, ffmpeg_flags=None, pipeline=None, profile=None, ffmpeg_reconnect_delay=None, ready_frames=1, ready_duration=None, ready_timeout=15.0, for_display=False)** - Return a capture object for the configured stream, trying FFmpeg first and using GStreamer as a fallback. The stream is considered ready only after ``ready_frames`` consecutive frames or ``ready_duration`` seconds of continuous frames are read within ``ready_timeout`` seconds (defaults: 1 frame, 15 seconds). When ``for_display`` is ``False``, the ``opencv`` backend is skipped. ``src_type`` defaults to the scheme-derived value and ``ffmpeg_reconnect_delay`` falls back to the ``ffmpeg_reconnect_delay`` setting in ``config.json``.

## Backend Selection and Fallback
`open_capture` attempts capture backends in priority order. By default the order is:

1. FFmpeg
2. GStreamer
3. OpenCV (only when ``for_display=True``)

When ``config["use_gstreamer"]`` is ``false``, GStreamer is removed from this list before any backends are attempted. When ``for_display`` is ``False``, ``opencv`` is removed as well, keeping headless deployments free of GUI dependencies.

You can override the order with the ``backend_priority`` argument or a ``backend`` override stored in Redis. If a backend fails to initialize or cannot satisfy the readiness criteria within ``ready_timeout`` seconds, the factory logs the error, stores the failure reason in ``camera_debug:<cam_id>``, and moves to the next backend. ``FFmpegCameraStream`` itself cycles through transports defined in ``retry_transports`` before other backends are attempted.
When ``config["use_gstreamer"]`` is ``False``, GStreamer is omitted from backend selection entirely.

### Pipeline profiles

Reusable capture settings can be defined in ``config.json`` under ``pipeline_profiles``. Each profile may specify a complete pipeline or command for its backend:

```json
"pipeline_profiles": {
  "gst_full": {
    "label": "Full GStreamer",
    "backend": "gstreamer",
    "pipeline": "rtspsrc location={url} latency=0 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
  },
  "ffmpeg_copy": {
    "label": "FFmpeg copy",
    "backend": "ffmpeg",
    "command": "-rtsp_transport tcp -i {url} -an"
  }
}
```

Selecting a profile via ``open_capture(..., profile="gst_full")`` applies its backend and full pipeline or command. The ``{url}`` placeholder is substituted with the camera address at runtime.


#### Precedence

``open_capture`` resolves settings in this order:

1. Explicit arguments
2. Redis overrides
3. Profile defaults

### Full pipeline profiles

The ``pipeline_profiles`` block can also describe complete pipelines for each
backend. The ``{url}`` placeholder below represents the camera's RTSP/HTTP
address.

#### GStreamer

```json
"pipeline_profiles": {
  "gst_full": {
    "label": "GStreamer TCP example",
    "backend": "gstreamer",
    "pipeline": "rtspsrc location={url} protocols=tcp latency=0 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
  }
}
```

Command-line equivalent:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream protocols=tcp latency=0 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! fakesink
```

Replace ``rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream`` with your camera URL.

#### FFmpeg

```json
"pipeline_profiles": {
  "ffmpeg_full": {
    "label": "FFmpeg TCP example",
    "backend": "ffmpeg",
    "ffmpeg_flags": "-rtsp_transport tcp -an -flags low_delay -fflags nobuffer"
  }
}
```

Command-line equivalent:

```bash
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp -flags low_delay -fflags nobuffer {url}
```

Replace ``{url}`` with your stream address.

#### OpenCV

```json
"pipeline_profiles": {
  "opencv_full": {
    "label": "OpenCV example",
    "backend": "opencv",
    "resolution": "720p"
  }
}
```

Command-line equivalent:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("{url}")
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    cv2.imshow("preview", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
        break
if hasattr(cap, "close"):
    cap.close()
else:
    cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
PY
```

Replace ``{url}`` with your camera URL. When tearing down a capture, prefer
``close()`` if the object provides it; OpenCV sources only support
``release()``.

## Inputs and Outputs
Refer to function signatures above for inputs and outputs.

## Redis Keys
- `camera_debug:<cam_id>` – JSON record describing the last initialization failure.

### `camera_debug` format
When initialization fails the factory writes a structured record to Redis. Each
attempt includes the backend that failed along with the exact command, exit
code, and any stderr output:

```json
{
  "attempts": [
    {
      "backend": "ffprobe",
      "command": "ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams rtsp://cam/stream",
      "exit_code": 1,
      "stderr": "unauthorized"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Stream unavailable for rtsp://cam/stream"
}
```

Retrieve a record with:

```bash
redis-cli get camera_debug:lobby
```

Example output for an authentication error:

```json
{
  "ts": "2024-05-01T12:00:00Z",
  "backend": "gstreamer",
  "message": "GStreamer init error: unauthorized (401)"
}
```

## Dependencies
- cv2
- gstreamer_stream
- loguru
- time

## Examples

### Switching between TCP and UDP

```python
from modules.camera_factory import open_capture

cap, transport = open_capture(
    "rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream",
    cam_id="lobby",
    src_type="rtsp",
    rtsp_transport="udp",  # use UDP instead of TCP
)
```

``open_capture`` first runs a short ``ffprobe`` against the RTSP URL using UDP
transport. If that fails within two seconds it retries using TCP and uses the
working address for the capture. Should the chosen transport still yield no
video during initialization, the factory falls back to the alternate transport
before raising an error.

### Using a full GStreamer pipeline

Define the pipeline in ``pipeline_profiles`` as shown above, then select it when opening the stream:

```python
cap, _ = open_capture(
    "rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream",
    cam_id="gate",
    profile="gst_full",
)
```

### Diagnosing common errors

When a backend fails, the reason is stored in Redis. A common message is
`no frames within timeout`. To troubleshoot:

1. **Check network reachability** – use tools like `ping` or `traceroute` to
   ensure the host is reachable.
2. **Verify credentials** – `401` or `403` responses indicate authentication
   problems; confirm the username and password.
3. **Switch RTSP transport** – toggle the `rtsp_transport` between `tcp` and
   `udp` to see which one the camera supports. When `tcp` is selected and the
   stream reports `NO_VIDEO_STREAM`, ``open_capture`` automatically retries the
   connection using UDP before failing.

Retrieve the latest failure record with:

```bash
redis-cli get camera_debug:lobby
```

Authentication problems often return `401` or `403` errors. Messages like
`No route to host` or repeated timeouts indicate network reachability issues.
Use `ping` or `traceroute` to verify connectivity.

### Adjusting readiness requirements

```python
# Require five consecutive frames
cap, transport = open_capture(
    "rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream",
    cam_id="lobby",
    ready_frames=5,
    ready_timeout=10.0,  # wait up to 10s for 5 consecutive frames
)

# Or require 2 seconds of steady frames
cap, transport = open_capture(
    "rtsp://user:pass@cam/stream",
    cam_id="lobby",
    ready_frames=0,
    ready_duration=2.0,
    ready_timeout=10.0,  # wait up to 10s for 2 seconds of frames
)
```
